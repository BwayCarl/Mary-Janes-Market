      <p className="large-para py-3">
Hay Mumford Farms was established in 2020 by me, Chris Mumford. I have been both a chef and gardener for over 40 years. I have spent most of my adult life teaching people how to grow, source and cook healthier food, mainly sourcing it from their own backyards or from local farms. During that time, I was working full-time as a professional chef. I created gardens at every location I worked at, and eventually when I started my own restaurant in 1989 in Long Branch, NJ, I included a large kitchen garden. Some years later, we moved our location to Tinton Falls, NJ and expanded our growing space for the restaurant immensely. During the 1990â€™s, I began to teach where and how to source your food, both ethically and responsibly. I taught cooking classes that emphasized the importance of cooking with organic and locally-grown food. As time passed, I learned more, and continued to pay attention to where I was buying the food for my business, and worked to grow as much as I could myself to supply the restaurant. Now, a few decades down the road, I have retired from full-time chef work, and have created my own farming and plant-growing business, with some catering too! My wife and I own two small farming locations, located in Monmouth County, New Jersey, and Barnard, Vermont. We both truly value knowing where to source good and healthy food, above all else! 
Whether it is produce or livestock, I appreciate how much love and passion goes into the growing & producing of food both organically and ethically. For me, it is a way of life now! I live everyday striving to be as environmentally conscious as possible, through growing methods that are more sustainable, by repurposing materials and recycling, by practicing good composting and using it to replenish the soil. I only use organic fertilizers and practice Integrated Pest Management, and only use organic pesticides when absolutely necessary. I like to focus on growing organically and I enjoy mentoring others to do the same. Overall, my mission is to protect Mother Earth, while responsibly growing for nutritional value first, and foremost.
